     <h1>About</h1>
   <p>Archery and Guitar are my favorite hobbies. I love playing my guitar and listening to the music I make. I take classes and I can play pretty good and have been taking classes for about 3 to 3 and a half years. I am also 12 years old and am going to 6th grade. I also love basketball and badminton and also play tennis. I love ping pong as well as enjoy taking walks. I play with many friends who live by me and have fun playing outside. </p>

    <p>I love playing guitar with all the songs and love just relaxing and going with the flow. 
What makes a guitar "good" is Quality Control. Good fretwork without sharp edges and consistent leveling, high quality body woods (just because it is the same wood doesn't mean it is of the same quality), good hardware that will last and stay in tune it heavy use, and good pickups.</p>

        <h1 class="guitar">Archery</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" class="guitar_22" src="learning-archery-south-do-011.jpg">
    <p>I love doing archery and the concentration and power is cool and nice. I like it for its touch. As most already know, archery is a sport rooted in accuracy which makes it a fun and easy way to improve hand-eye coordination skills, upper body strength, core stability, and balance! Archery engages the arms, shoulders, back, core, and legs to create a consistent and repeatable shot.</p>

    <img src="IMG_5265.jpg">    
    <p>I had many inspirations like for guitar I thpught it could clear my ming and it will be a fun instument to play. I also thought archery would be fun and it could used for self protection. I had my dad where he played in ping pong tounaments and I got that interest from him. I also got the interest of badminton the same way as he is a state champion in india. My Granpda is a chess and pool champion. I got both of those interests the same way.</p>
